Dijkstra-algorithm is a method for finding the shortest paths from a start node to all other nodes in a graph.

Step.1:  Start by initializing the distance to the startnode as 0 and all other nodes as âˆž.
Step.2: Maintain a set of visited nodes, initially empty.
Step.3: For the current node, update the distances to its unvisited neighbors if a shorter path is found.
Step.4: Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.
Step.5: Repeat the process until all nodes have been visited.
